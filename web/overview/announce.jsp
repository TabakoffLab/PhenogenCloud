        Summary of this webinar:<BR>
        This presentation will guide attendees with how to access genome-wide association study summary statistics and showcase resources available for
        annotating these summary data for follow-up analyses, including gene-based analyses, eQTL, and epigenetic annotation as well as causal variable
        analysis.
        We will guide attendees through components of a GWAS summary dataset and two excellent resources - FUMA and MASSIVE - that use these summary files as
        inputs to generate vast amounts of annotations that can be brought forward to answer translational research questions.

        Summary of this webinar:<BR>
        The Mouse Phenome Database (MPD; https://phenome.jax.org) is a widely used resource that provides access to primary experimental data, protocols, and
        analysis tools for mouse phenotyping studies. Data are contributed by investigators around the world and represent a broad scope of phenotyping
        endpoints
        and disease-related characteristics in na√Øve mice and those exposed to drugs, environmental agents, or other treatments. MPD is engineered to facilitate
        interactive data exploration and quantitative analysis. It encompasses data from inbred strains and other reproducible panels, including HMDP, KOMP,
        Collaborative Cross (CC), CC-RIX, and founder strains, along with primary data from mapping populations, including historic mapping crosses and advanced
        high-diversity mouse populations such as Diversity Outbred mice. A new Study Intake Platform (SIP) for data contributors allows domain experts to submit
        and
        annotate their own data with relevant ontology terms. Data contributors also provide detailed information for protocols and animal environmental
        conditions
        to fulfill ARRIVE guidelines. Data are exposed to analysis tools within MPD and are available through APIs to other systems. We will demonstrate
        selected
        MPD tools, including GenomeMUSter (a new imputed SNP grid on 500+ strains of mice, 83+M locations) and a GWAS metanalysis tool.
        <BR><BR>

        Summary of this webinar:<BR>
        Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language that is gaining popularity. The Julia language is designed for scientific computing and offers
        several
        attractive features for data science applications. In this webinar, we will make a case for why a data scientist might consider taking a serious look at
        Julia. We will show code examples and point the audience to further resources.

    <H2>Added multiMiR</H2>
    <div style=" margin-left:5px;">

        Using multiMiR(an R package available <a href="http://multimir.ucdenver.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>) you can view validated and predicted
        miRNAs
        that
        target specific genes. You can also select a miRNA and view all genes targeted by the miRNA. multiMiR is avaialble as a new tab for a selected
        gene
        in
        the Genome/Transcriptome Data Browser and in Gene Lists after selecting a list. It is currently available only for mouse genes, but will be
        available in
        rat soon.

    <H2>Added Rat Liver Transcriptome</H2>
    <div style=" margin-left:5px;">
        We've added rat liver tracks including, a transcriptome reconstructiong track, splice junction track, and stranded read depth count tracks.
        Available in
