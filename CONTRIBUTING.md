# How to contribute
There's a list of known issues https://github.com/TabakoffLab/PhenogenCloud/issues and take a look if there's anything that you can address.


# Local setup
Using the "fork and pull request" [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)  


## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to PhengenCloud https://github.com/TabakoffLab/PhenogenCloud/pulls with a clear list of what you've done 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions
